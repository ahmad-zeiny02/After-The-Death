        <h1>Is There Life After Death? Is There a God?</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <section>
            <p>Many people today question the existence of God and life after death. It’s natural to wonder about these profound topics, especially in a world that values tangible evidence. However, just because we cannot see or touch something doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. Let’s reflect together on these questions and explore whether the answers lie deeper than we first imagine.</p>

            <h2>The Complexity of the Universe: Evidence of a Creator</h2>
            <p>Look at the world around you. The intricate design of nature, the laws of physics, the vastness of the universe, and the fine-tuned conditions that make life possible all point to an intelligent Creator. For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Why does the Earth orbit the sun at just the right distance to sustain life?</li>
                <li>How do the complex systems within the human body work in perfect harmony?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These phenomena suggest that the universe is not a product of random chance. The Qur'an beautifully addresses this:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <span class="quran">"Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the alternation of the night and the day, are signs for those of understanding."</span> (Qur'an 3:190)
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Life’s Purpose: Is There More Than This?</h2>
            <p>If there’s no God and no life after death, what is the purpose of life? Are we merely here to eat, sleep, work, and eventually disappear? Deep down, many of us sense that there must be more to our existence. This inner longing for meaning is not random—it’s a sign of something greater.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <span class="quran">"Did you think that We created you aimlessly and that you would not be returned to Us?"</span> (Qur'an 23:115)
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Justice Demands an Afterlife</h2>
            <p>In the world we live in, we often see injustice. Good people sometimes suffer, while wrongdoers often escape punishment. If there’s no life after death, how can ultimate justice be achieved?</p>
            <blockquote>
                <span class="quran">"Every soul will taste death. And We test you with evil and with good as trial; and to Us you will be returned."</span> (Qur'an 21:35)
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Science and Faith: Complementary, Not Opposed</h2>
            <p>Science often explains how things work, but it doesn’t answer why they exist in the first place. For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Science can describe how rain forms, but why does the water cycle exist in such a perfect way to sustain life?</li>
                <li>Science can explain the process of human birth, but why does life itself exist?</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
                <span class="quran">"And He has subjected to you whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth—all from Him. Indeed, in that are signs for a people who give thought."</span> (Qur'an 45:13)
            </blockquote>

            <h2>What Happens After Death?</h2>
            <p>The fear of death and the unknown is universal. If life ends completely at death, why do humans instinctively fear it? This fear suggests that our souls know there is more to come.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <span class="quran">"The grave is the first stage of the Hereafter. If one is saved from it, what follows will be easier for him; and if he is not saved, what follows will be more severe."</span> (Sunan al-Tirmidhi)
            </blockquote>

            <h2>A Final Thought</h2>
            <p>Imagine for a moment that you’re right and there is no God or life after death. What is lost by living a moral, purposeful life and believing in something greater? Now imagine the opposite—that God and the Hereafter are real. The stakes become infinitely higher.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <span class="quran">"So whoever does an atom’s weight of good will see it, and whoever does an atom’s weight of evil will see it."</span> (Qur'an 99:7-8)
            </blockquote>
            <p>May we all open our hearts and minds to the truth, seeking answers with sincerity and humility. Life is too precious to leave these questions unanswered.</p>
